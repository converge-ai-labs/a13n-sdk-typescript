## Contract update

Pinned Service source: https://github.com/converge-ai-labs/agent-foundation/commit/$commit

Changes since the accepted SDK pin: https://github.com/converge-ai-labs/agent-foundation/compare/$previous...$commit

This rolling draft imports committed OpenAPI and thread-stream definitions, API conventions,
and the Runs, Facts and Delivery, and API semantics, with source paths,
and includes SDK-local HTTP type generation. Full SDK CI runs while this PR is still a draft.
Only changed contract inputs trigger this update; the source compare also provides implementation context.
It does not execute Service code or imply that this SDK already supports the new contract.

## Maintainer acceptance

Review compatibility and non-HTTP behavior against the owning specifications, adapt handwritten
code/templates and protocol tests as needed, regenerate and run \`make check-all\`.
Resolve CI failures and review the latest source SHA before marking ready and merging.
Changed contract inputs return this PR to draft; keep review notes outside the marked source block.

A failed generation or incompatible change requires adaptation, not a silent contract downgrade.
No release, tag, auto-merge or package version change is requested by this automation.
