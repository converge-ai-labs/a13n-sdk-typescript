## Contract update

Pinned Service source: https://github.com/converge-ai-labs/agent-foundation/commit/$commit

Changes since the accepted SDK pin: https://github.com/converge-ai-labs/agent-foundation/compare/$previous...$commit

This draft imports committed HTTP/wire definitions, shared fixtures, API conventions,
Native streaming semantics and queued-submission semantics, with source paths and SHA-256 hashes.
The compare includes implementation changes even when exported schemas are unchanged.
It does not execute Service code or imply that this SDK already supports the new contract.

## Maintainer acceptance

- [ ] Review the source range, compatibility and non-HTTP behavior against the owning specifications.
- [ ] Run \`make generate\`; adapt handwritten code/templates and add protocol tests as needed.
- [ ] Run \`make check-all\` and commit generated/adaptation changes to this branch.
- [ ] Mark this PR ready and require the SDK CI result before merging through normal review.

A failed generation or incompatible change requires adaptation, not a silent contract downgrade.
No release, tag, auto-merge or package version change is requested by this automation.
